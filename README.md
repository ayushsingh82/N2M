# N2M Loop - NEAR Intents Subscription Platform

A revolutionary subscription payment platform built on NEAR Protocol that eliminates the complexity of cross-chain payments. Subscribe to recurring payments without worrying about which token or which chain - NEAR intents handle everything automatically.

## üöÄ Problem Statement

Traditional subscription services face major challenges:

- **Chain Complexity**: Users must manage multiple wallets across different blockchains
- **Token Confusion**: Different tokens on different chains create friction
- **High Gas Fees**: Expensive transaction costs on various networks
- **Manual Management**: Users must manually execute recurring payments
- **Cross-Chain Barriers**: Difficulty in sending payments across different blockchains

## üí° Solution: NEAR Intents Subscription Platform

Our platform solves these problems by leveraging NEAR Protocol's intent-based architecture:

- **Single Wallet**: Use only your NEAR wallet for all subscriptions
- **Any Token, Any Chain**: Send USDC, USDT, ETH, BTC to any blockchain automatically
- **Automated Execution**: Cron jobs handle recurring payments seamlessly
- **Cross-Chain Magic**: NEAR intents bridge all blockchains transparently
- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient cross-chain transfers with minimal fees
